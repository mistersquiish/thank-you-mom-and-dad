However, leaving China meant leaving behind government housing and food stamps and starting completely new. The decision my parents made was a difficult one, and I'm not sure if I would have had the conviction to choose.

Even though we had enough money to purchase normal food, my father would deliberately wait until the market closed, so he could purchase the scraps and leftovers at a discount. He pocketed the savings for his own use, never once giving it back to his family. When I wanted to buy an educational book, my father would scold me for just asking.

A friend of mine told me about the city of Laredo. It was a city that was growing fast, and the proximity to Mexico made for many business opportunities. In 1991, I came to Laredo.
